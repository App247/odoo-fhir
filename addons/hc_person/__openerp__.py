    'description': """
        An individual has identity outside of a healthcare setting. The Person resource is used to capture 
        this information and to relate the person as an individual to other resources that do have a health-related context.

        For example, while a patient resource may be created and maintained by each organization providing 
        care for that person as a patient, a person resource provides a mechanism for linking patient resources 
        across different organizations and their unique patient identity domains.
